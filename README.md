# BrIW: The Uber for drinks
A question has plagued thinkers since the dawn of time. <em>'What doth life?'</em>
This app may not be able to answer that question, but it will make sure
you and your team's thirst is suffiecently quenched as you search for answers.

BrIW rounds aren't about drinks. They're about being yourself. It's designed
for the dreamers, the thinkers and the believers in change. Those who refuse to
stand by and let the world move on without them. This is the next step
in humanities evolution. Make the change that will help
you be the person you want to be. Help your team be the best. Society won't
wait, and neither should you.

 BrIW was designed using only cutting edge technology, that has been
 devleoped in the last 20 years. We don't sacrifice on the essentials, and
 neither should you. Future plans include machine learning, block-chain and VR
 integration. And best of all it's <span>free!</span>

 So sign up today and let BrIW become part of your team.
